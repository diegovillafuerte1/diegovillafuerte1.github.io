user_description: I'm an experienced XR Software Developer, always searching for a new opportunity. Lately, I have been immersed in the <b>DevOps-world</b> working for HCL UrbanCode, a Cleveland-based Enterprise DevOps lab pioneering value stream visualization. I'm splitting my time between product development and research into integrating AR into our product.
